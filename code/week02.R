# ==============================================================================
# ECON 895  Spatial Techniques in Empirical Economics
# Week 2, 31 August 2026.  Vector Data, Distance, and IVs
#
# HOW TO USE THIS FILE
#   1. Open ECON895.Rproj first. That sets the working directory to the repo
#      root, which is why every path below starts with data/ and not ../data/
#      or a path from your own machine.
#   2. Work down the file. The heading on each block gives the slide it goes
#      with, so you can read the deck and the code side by side.
#   3. Blocks marked PREDICT are the ones we voted on in class. Commit to an
#      answer before you run them. Being wrong is the point.
#
# One new package this week. AER, for the instrumental-variables slides:
#   install.packages("AER")

  filter(!(is.na(longitude) | is.na(latitude))) %>%
  st_as_sf(coords = c("longitude", "latitude"), crs = 4326, remove = FALSE)

# The .prj on this shapefile is complete, and it is on ED50 rather than WGS84.
# Transform it. Do not relabel it. Relabelling moves every border about 355 m.
europe_sf <- st_read("data/europe_modern.shp", quiet = TRUE) %>%
  st_transform(4326) %>%
  st_make_valid()

mainz <- cities_sf %>% filter(city_jjk == "MAINZ")


# ---- Slide 8. Why not base R, and library() vs require() ---------------------
packageVersion("dplyr"); packageVersion("sf")

# The slide says library() fails loudly and require() does not. Run these two
# one at a time and watch the difference.
require(notarealpackage)       # returns FALSE, warns, and CARRIES ON
library(notarealpackage)       # errors and stops

# A script that opens with require() will sail past a missing package and fail
# forty lines later on something that looks unrelated.


# ---- Slide 9. A tibble is a data frame with better manners -------------------
class(cps08)
print(cps08, n = 3)

nrow(cps08)             # 7,711. A base data frame would have printed all of it.

class(cps08["ahe"])     # tibble, one column
class(cps08[["ahe"]])   # numeric vector


# ---- Slide 11. Subsetting dplyr-style ----------------------------------------
select(cps08, age, ahe)
filter(cps08, age == 33)

nrow(cps08); nrow(filter(cps08, age == 33))   # count both sides, always


# ---- Slide 12. Sorting, renaming, and changing variables ---------------------
# Notice what it costs to use three verbs together without a pipe.
tmp <- rename(cps08, wage = ahe)
tmp <- mutate(tmp, lwage = log(wage))
head(arrange(tmp, desc(lwage)), 3)


# ---- Slide 13. The pipe operator ---------------------------------------------
cps08 %>%
  rename(wage = ahe) %>%
  mutate(lwage = log(wage)) %>%
  arrange(desc(lwage)) %>%
  select(age, wage, lwage) %>%
  print(n = 3)

# Same answer, no tmp. Check that rather than take it on faith:
identical(head(arrange(tmp, desc(lwage)), 3),
          cps08 %>% rename(wage = ahe) %>% mutate(lwage = log(wage)) %>%
            arrange(desc(lwage)) %>% head(3))

# The dot. %>% hands the left side to the FIRST argument on the right. Where you
# need it somewhere else, . stands in for it. You need this later tonight.
cps08 %>% nrow()
cps08 %>% nrow(.)


# ---- Slide 14. Grouping and summarizing --------------------------------------
cps08 %>%
  group_by(female, bachelor) %>%
  summarize(mean_ahe = mean(ahe), .groups = "drop")

# .groups controls what grouping is left ON THE RESULT. The default is
# "drop_last", which peels one level and leaves the rest attached, silently.
g <- cps08 %>% group_by(female) %>% mutate(m = mean(ahe))
group_vars(g)                                  # still grouped

nrow(g %>% summarize(n = n()))                 # 2. one row per group.
nrow(g %>% ungroup() %>% summarize(n = n()))   # 1. what you meant.

# Neither errors. The wrong one is a perfectly reasonable-looking number.


# ---- Slide 15. PREDICT. The join that eats your data -------------------------
# How many rows come back? Write your answer down before you run it.
lookup <- tibble(age = 25:30, cohort = "prime")

nrow(cps08)                                    # before
joined <- inner_join(cps08, lookup, by = "age")
nrow(joined)                                   # after

# Count rows on both sides of every join, and then look at what you kept.
# Week 1's Tanzania join is why the second half of that sentence matters.


# ---- Slide 16. Getting data in and out ---------------------------------------
saveRDS(cps08, "data/cps08.rds")
cps08 <- readRDS("data/cps08.rds")
unlink("data/cps08.rds")            # tidy up; this file is not tracked

# haven reads Stata, SPSS and SAS. readxl reads Excel. Both install with the
# tidyverse. Real example rather than the placeholder name on the slide:
library(haven)
head(read_dta(system.file("examples", "iris.dta", package = "haven")), 2)

# The slide says a CSV cannot carry a CRS. Do not take that on faith.
pts <- cities_sf %>% select(city_jjk, countryname)
class(pts)                          # "sf"

f <- tempfile(fileext = ".csv")
write_csv(pts, f)                   # NO error. It writes a file quite happily.
back <- read_csv(f, show_col_types = FALSE)
inherits(back, "sf")                # FALSE. The geometry is now text.
names(back)

f2 <- tempfile(fileext = ".rds")
saveRDS(pts, f2)
inherits(readRDS(f2), "sf")         # TRUE
st_crs(readRDS(f2))$epsg            # 4326, still there
unlink(c(f, f2))

# write_csv() succeeded. It just quietly stopped being spatial.


# ---- Slide 19. What is underneath sf -----------------------------------------
sf_extSoftVersion()[c("GEOS", "GDAL", "PROJ")]

nrow(st_drivers())        # file formats GDAL exposes on your machine

# Your versions will differ from mine. That is the point: pinning sf means
# pinning GDAL, GEOS and PROJ too, and their error messages are not R's.


# ---- Slide 20. Basic simple features -----------------------------------------
st_point(c(8.27, 50.00))                                  # Mainz
st_linestring(rbind(c(8.27, 50.0), c(2.35, 48.86)))       # Mainz to Paris
st_polygon(list(rbind(c(0,0), c(1,0), c(1,1), c(0,1), c(0,0))))


# ---- Slide 21. Anatomy of an sf object ---------------------------------------
# The three colours on that figure are three real classes. Build them upward.
p  <- st_point(c(8.27, 50.0))               # one geometry
class(p)

pc <- st_sfc(p, crs = 4326)                 # a geometry COLUMN
class(pc)
st_crs(pc)$epsg                             # the CRS lives on the column

f  <- st_sf(city = "Mainz", geometry = pc)  # a tibble with that column
class(f)
f

# An sf object is a data frame whose geometry column knows what a coordinate
# reference system is. Nothing more exotic than that.


# ---- Slide 23. Loading vector data -------------------------------------------
europe_raw <- st_read("data/europe_modern.shp")   # read what it prints

# Driver, geometry type, bounding box, CRS. The CRS line is the one that
# matters and the one people skip. Note this is NOT called europe_sf: the
# object you read is not yet the object you analyze.


# ---- Slide 24. Learning about this data I ------------------------------------
class(cities_sf)
st_crs(cities_sf)$epsg

# ---- Slide 32. A tale of two cities ------------------------------------------
cty1 <- tibble(name = "Nairobi", lon = 36.82241, lat = -1.287822) %>%

cty2  <- cty2 %>% st_transform(4326)
ctys  <- rbind(cty1, cty2)

# ---- Slide 34. Distances redux -----------------------------------------------
st_distance(cty1, cty2)

# Units are the smaller question. Whether the projection suits the measurement
# is the larger one. Same five degrees of longitude, walked north:
gap <- function(lat) {

# Germany, measured three ways. Which one is wrong, and by how much?
de <- europe_sf %>% filter(CntryName == "Germany")

as.numeric(st_area(de)) / 1e6                       # 4326, geodetic

as.numeric(st_area(st_transform(de, 3857))) / 1e6   # Web Mercator

# Germany is about 357,600 km2. Web Mercator is off by a factor of sec^2(lat):
lat <- st_coordinates(st_centroid(st_geometry(de)))[2]
1 / cos(lat * pi / 180)^2

# The wrong number is correctly labelled as square metres. Units would not have
# caught this. Equal-area before st_area(): EPSG:3035 in Europe, 5070 in the US.


# ---- Slide 37. An aside on units ---------------------------------------------
a_to_b <- st_distance(cty1, cty2)

# Mainz itself is row one at zero kilometers, so we start at two.


# ---- Slide 42. The instrument, drawn -----------------------------------------

# ---- Slide 45. The first stage -----------------------------------------------
press <- read_csv("data/europe_press_1500.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)

est <- cities_sf %>% st_drop_geometry() %>%
  filter(!city_jjk %in% c("ALBA", "HALLE")) %>%  # one name, two cities

fs <- lm(press1500 ~ km_mainz + log(pop1500), data = est)
round(summary(fs)$coefficients, 6)

# A hundred kilometers closer to Mainz raises the probability of a press by
# about 1.4 points, t = -5.2. Relevance holds.


# ---- Slide 46. PREDICT. Now estimate the thing you care about ----------------
# OLS says printing cities grew 14 log points faster. Predict the sign of the
# IV estimate before you run this.
ols <- lm(growth ~ press1500 + log(pop1500), data = est)
rf  <- lm(growth ~ km_mainz  + log(pop1500), data = est)

c(OLS = coef(ols)["press1500"],               # both estimates
  IV  = coef(rf)["km_mainz"] / coef(fs)["km_mainz"])

# Just-identified, so the IV estimate is exactly the ratio of the reduced form
# to the first stage. That is what 2SLS is. The standard error is not a ratio,
# though, so for that we need the real thing:
library(AER)
iv <- ivreg(growth ~ press1500 + log(pop1500) | km_mainz + log(pop1500),
            data = est)
round(summary(iv)$coefficients["press1500", ], 3)

# Read the standard error, not just the estimate. The interval runs from about
# -0.95 to +0.04. It excludes neither zero nor a large negative effect. The
# instrument did not overturn OLS. It declined to confirm it.


# ---- Slide 47. Where is the variation actually coming from? ------------------
# Distance from Mainz IS position. Watch it dissolve as the regression is told
# where each city sits.
f1 <- lm(press1500 ~ km_mainz + log(pop1500), data = est)
f2 <- update(f1, . ~ . + longitude + latitude)
f3 <- update(f1, . ~ . + poly(longitude, 2) + poly(latitude, 2))

round(sapply(list(f1, f2, f3),
       function(m) summary(m)$coefficients["km_mainz", "t value"]^2), 1)

# 27.1, 15.2, 0.0. Strong, weak, gone. Dittmar conditions on latitude,
# longitude and their interaction, so his identifying variation is what
# survives that. Ours is the raw continental gradient. Different variation,
# not a worse computation.


# ---- Slide 49. The biggest move came from a table note -----------------------
est <- est %>% mutate(ldist = log(pmax(km_mainz, 1)))
wald <- function(dat, inst, ctrl) {

      `+ his controls`           = wald(his, "ldist",    geo),
      `Dittmar (2011) Table VII` = c(0.58, 410)) %>% round(3)

# The largest single move is the middle row, and it is not a modelling choice.
# It is one sentence in his table note restricting the sample. We never reach
# his number, and the honest reason is that our print cities grew nine
# percentage points faster than the rest where he reports about twenty. This
# is our two-line version of his design, not a replication of it.
